- My name is Cindy Arely 
I studied Neuroscience and Psychology as well as worked in research throughout all my professional career.
I learned coding with R and not necessarily Python but here we are lol Basically the same? I had to dumb it down with Jupyter is to VS what R Markdown is to R. Smooth brain over here lol
