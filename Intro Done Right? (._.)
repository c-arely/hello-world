#Hi 
## **This is my second go on the introduction bc the first one was done so I could undrstand the steps!**

- My name is Cindy Arely 
I studied Neuroscience and Psychology as well as worked in research throughout all my professional career.
I learned coding with R and not necessarily Python but here we are lol Basically the same? I had to dumb it down with Jupyter is to VS what R Markdown is to R. Smooth brain over here lol


- I still dont know exactly what I am doing but I know I am excited to integrate my behavioral research background with analysis, coding and AI.
